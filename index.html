                    <h2>Dhaka's Traffic Overview</h2>
                    <img src="assets/T1.webp" alt="Girl in a jacket" width=100%>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, faces some of the most severe
                        traffic congestion in the world.
                        One of the primary reasons is the limited allocation of urban space to road infrastructure—only
                        about 7% of the city's area is dedicated to roads. This is drastically low compared to
                        international standards, where many modern cities allocate 20-25% or more.

                        The city’s transportation network was originally designed to accommodate traffic volumes and
                        patterns from the 1930s, a time when motorized vehicles were scarce and the population was
                        significantly smaller. Fast forward to today, Dhaka is now home to over 2.4 million registered
                        vehicles, all competing for space on a network that has seen minimal structural expansion
                        relative to the rapid urbanization and population boom.

                        This outdated infrastructure, combined with unregulated urban growth, lack of efficient public
                        transportation, poor traffic management, and inadequate pedestrian facilities, has resulted in a
                        chaotic and inefficient traffic system. Daily commutes often extend to hours for distances that
                        should take minutes, significantly impacting productivity, air quality, and quality of life.

                        Efforts have been made in recent years to improve the situation, such as the construction of
                        flyovers, the introduction of the Dhaka Metro Rail, and various traffic control initiatives.
                        However, without a comprehensive overhaul of the transportation system and better integration of
                        land use and mobility planning, traffic congestion will remain a persistent challenge for the
                        city.</p>

                    <h2>Farmgate</h2>
                    <p>Farmgate is one of the most traffic-congested areas in Dhaka, serving as a central point that
                        connects various parts of the city. It is surrounded by commercial buildings, coaching centers,
                        government offices, and educational institutions, attracting thousands of people daily. Buses
                        stop frequently to pick up and drop off passengers, causing lane blockages. The narrow roads,
                        lack of designated bus stops, and the presence of rickshaws and street vendors further intensify
                        the traffic pressure. During school and office hours, traffic in this area often comes to a
                        complete standstill.

                    <h2>Mohakhali Intersection</h2>
                    <p>Mohakhali is a crucial transportation node that connects to key neighborhoods like Gulshan,
                        Banani, and Tejgaon. The Mohakhali Bus Terminal, one of Dhaka’s busiest inter-district
                        terminals, adds significant pressure to the local road network. Vehicles entering and exiting
                        the terminal often obstruct the main road, while local buses, rickshaws, and motorbikes weave
                        through traffic with little regulation. Office buildings, hospitals, and shops lining the roads
                        add to pedestrian movement, making it one of the most chaotic intersections in the city.

                    <h2>Moghbazar-Mouchak Flyover Area</h2>
                    <p>The Moghbazar-Mouchak area was supposed to benefit from a multi-level flyover system designed to
                        ease congestion. However, the flyover has not significantly reduced traffic at ground level.
                        Vehicles exiting and entering the flyover often merge unpredictably with ground-level traffic,
                        causing frequent jams. The area has several intersections, including the Siddeshwari and Ramna
                        roads, which intersect at awkward angles. Heavy commercial activity and a lack of traffic signal
                        coordination contribute to severe congestion, especially during the morning and evening rush
                        hours.

                    <h2>Gulistan Intersection</h2>
                    <p>Gulistan, located in Old Dhaka, is both a commercial hub and a key transportation point. The area
                        is lined with bustling street markets, numerous bus counters, and informal vendors, leaving
                        little space for smooth vehicular movement. Public buses dominate the roads, often stopping
                        haphazardly to pick up passengers. The road network here is narrow and outdated, with little
                        scope for expansion. Combined with poor traffic management and a high volume of pedestrian
                        crossings, the intersection frequently experiences gridlock that affects adjacent areas like
                        Bangabazar and Paltan.

                    <h2>Jatrabari Intersection</h2>
                    <p>Jatrabari serves as a major exit and entry point for vehicles traveling to and from southern
                        parts of Bangladesh. The Dhaka-Chittagong highway begins here, making it a strategic but heavily
                        burdened location. Long-haul buses, trucks, and cargo vehicles regularly clog the roads. The
                        presence of wholesale markets, schools, and local businesses adds to the complexity of the
                        traffic flow. Roadside stalls, unauthorized parking, and poor traffic enforcement make the
                        situation worse, often creating tailbacks that stretch for kilometers, especially during
                        weekends and holidays.
